**Description**: The purpose of this about me project has been to create a "virtual business card" website about myself. I've learned many things and have picked up on many skills while working on this project. I have learned stuff like adding images to my HTML, color in css, adding a web form to contact me, created a nav bar and fun effects to make my website look nicer. In this project I have been able to share things and people that I love with my professor(s) 

**Color Scheme**: Throughout my about me website I have used two major colors like #E8E8E8 as my background color , #AA336A for my font color and in my contact form I used both #E75480 and #601A35 as my major colors.
