            <p>By now you know my name is Leslie Acevedo. A little about me is that I am from mexico, I love trying new things but my love for mexican food will always be the best food I have tried, I have an older brother and younger brother making me the only daughter. I am 18 years old and currently in my first semester at RVCC and I am majoring in IT and in the future I want to be...</p>
            <p>an IT manager. I am very passionate in mostly hardware and software related things to do with IT but I have enjoyed this class learning a little bit about coding. My passion for IT has grown deeper since working at the Geek Squad department in Best buy. I have had great co-workers who have become friends who have taught me alot and I am still learning and cannot wait to keep learning new things!</p>

    <h2>Image hover effects</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Image hover effects are a visual change / transiston that happens when you move your cursor over an image. These hover effects are a fun tool that makes the user viewing your webpage more interactive. Alot of websties use this technique to provide more information about a specific thing or image.</p>

        <p>With Image hover effects there are so many different combinations, I took some things that I read about, saw in videos on youtube while reasearching this topic and I used it to create a hover effect on my photo gallery , I loved the way it turned out because now my webpage looks nice.</p>
